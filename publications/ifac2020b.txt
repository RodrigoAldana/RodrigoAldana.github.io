abstract = {As the main contribution, this document provides a consistent discretization of a class of fixed-time stable systems, namely predefined-time stable systems. In the unperturbed case, the proposed approach allows obtaining not only a consistent but exact discretization of the considered class of predefined-time stable systems, whereas in the perturbed case, the consistent discretization preserves the predefined-time stability property. All the results are validated through simulations and compared with the conventional explicit Euler scheme, highlighting the advantages of this proposal.}
